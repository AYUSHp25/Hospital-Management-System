The Hospital Management System (HMS) project is a Java-based application designed to facilitate administrative tasks within a hospital environment. It features a user-friendly login interface where administrators can securely authenticate using a username and password, with password security enhanced through MD5 hashing. The system connects to a MySQL database to validate user credentials and provides functionalities such as clearing input fields, navigating to a home screen, and resetting forgotten passwords. The application is built using Java Swing for the graphical user interface (GUI), ensuring a clean and intuitive design. Key features include error handling for invalid inputs, secure database interactions, and seamless navigation between different modules, such as the admin dashboard and password recovery. Overall, the HMS project aims to streamline hospital administration by providing a robust, secure, and efficient management tool.
